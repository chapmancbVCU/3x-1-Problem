Machines being tested:
* 2021 MacBook Air with M1 processor, 8GB RAM, 8 Core CPU, 7 Core GPU, Translated with Rosetta 2, MacOS
* 2019 (Purchased in 2021 as new) 16" MacBook Pro, 16 GB, 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, MacOS

Just for fun I included times for:
* 2013 13" MacBook Pro, Ubuntu
* 2012 Lenovo P500, Rocky Linux

Single Pass:

Times are in microseconds

Summary: 
A direct comparison shows that the Intal 16" MacBook Pro wins compared to the M1.  Who could this be?
Consider that both machines are running the same version of Java and compiled by the same version of
the Java JDK by Amazon.  Despite the M1 oblierating the Intel machine in almost all Geek Bench
tests the biggest drawback is the extra layer of computation that involves Rosetta 2.

Will the M1 win against the Intel machine using another language like C++?  It is a strong
possibility if you use a compiler that outputs an executable that runs directly on the M1 architcture.
You could also assume the same with a Java Runtime Environment that runs directly on the M1 chip.  We
will have to wait and see when a JRE becomes available.

Results:
1st place:  Intel MacBook Pro
2nd place:  2012 Lenovo
3rd place:  M1 MacBook Air
4th place:  2013 13" MacBook Pro
